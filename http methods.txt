REQUEST METHODS:

1)GET METHOD--get data i.e expecting data from server side
2)POST METHOD-to send data i.e submitting data to server side program

GET REQUEST:
-by default it is get request
-Get can also submit data(but small or limited amount of data) and that data will be displayed on browser window
 i.e if get is used,query string can be visible on browser
 but post-->query string is not visible thats why it is more reliable

Limitations of get req:
1)URL length shud not be more than 256 charcaters
 in get-->query string will be appended to url
 in post-->vice versa
2)data entered or query string is visible

q)how will you know whether it is get req or post req?
 Get req can be made in 3 ways:

1)typing url
2)submit form
3)hyperlink

post req can be performed only in one way
1)submit form

q)what is diff btw GET and POST
GET:
1)it is  default req model
2)gets data from server side program,here we can also post limited data to server side program
3)query string is visible
4)limited data can only be posted to server side application bcoz there is limitation for length of url
5)sensitive data like pw username cannot be posted

6)get req can be made in 3 ways-a mentioned above

POST:
1)itv is not default
2)posts data to server side program
3)query string not visible
4)unlimited data can be posted
5)any type of data can be posted
6)post req can be made only in one way:i.e-submitting forms


process:
whenever enduser sends--->request...>to web application
then internally--->http req object will be created and that http req object--->passed as a parameter to...>corresponding view fn 
view fn-->process the req--->create http response object
puts the data into response object and ---->forwards response object to client(web browser)


post:

syntax:
variablename=request.POST['key']
ex:x=int(request.POST['t1'])

GET"
suntax:variablename=request.GET['key'])
y=int(request.GET['t1'])



how view identifies post req are recived by post or get req?

by checking method="get"
or method="post"

so accordingly view can use (request.GET) or (request.POST) 
ex:
def input(request):
 if request.method=="get":
-------
--------
 else:
---------
-------

--->uptonow data is displayed in text format but now we want HTML page as o/p for that in response obj,we write html code so make this chnages:



->{{ }}.....>template tag and code within this we call it jinja2 code

why template tag?
-for passing dynamic content from views to template file

#passing multiple dict values to a template file
#passing currentday,currentmonth,currentyear to a template file
